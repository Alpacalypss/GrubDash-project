# GrubDash Backend project for Thinkful

Overall this project was super enjoyable, and good practice, especially for using res.locals. When I learn a little bit more, I know I can and intend to revisit this project and clean it up. 
I had to repeat a lot of code to get all the tests to pass, and I know I can tidy it. That being said I feel I was able to come up with some creative solutions to some of the issues I was coming across trying to get the tests to pass.
This is attempt submission number one, and looking forward to some feedback in ways I could improve my answers, or where I could clean up some of my repeated code snippets.

Specifically the res.locals practice was super helpful. It was confusing at first trying to wrap my head around expanding the scope of variables declared inside of functions, but with the repition of it needed in this project, I think I got a good handle on it.
